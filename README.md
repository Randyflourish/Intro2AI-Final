# Intro2AI-Final
NYCU 2024 Spring introduction to AI team 11 final project.

The entire project is executing on google colab.

## Env
Please download the env package from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11iW9lRNIN7G4Unwsz48RIzTxAUmnGyvW?usp=sharing
, and upload it into your google drive (make sure the space is enough).
Or you can create a copy to your google drive directly from the link above.
P.S. The package size is larger than 1 GB, so we cannot put it on github repo.

Please do not rename the env folder; otherwise, you should update the path in the notebook file.

Note that the env file and model weights should on the top of your google drive, just like the screenshot below.
